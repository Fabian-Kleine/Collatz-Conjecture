# Collatz Conjecture
Collatz Conjecture describes a mathematical problem which works as follows. You start with a random number, if that number is even you devide it by 2, if it is odd you multiply it by 3 and add 1. By applying these formulas onto the outcome of the previous function you will eventually end up at a loop of 4, 2, and 1. This Webapp calculates how many steps it takes to reach 1.
